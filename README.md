# _printf
This repository contains a group project of printf equally contributed by Kaleab Girma and Joseph Mulugeta.
This project contains a project task for defining a printf custom function with format specifiers based on the concepts we have covered with Alx software engineering till now.
## What is Printf?
Printf function is a function that is defined in the stdio.h header file and used to print texts and parameters specified by limited number of format specifiers.
### Format Specifiers
format specifiers are special set of placeholders used to represent a parameter to be passed in the function of printf.
The following are some of the format specifiers we use in printf function.
* **%c
        * print a single character %d print a decimal (base 10) number 

* **%e
        * print an exponential floating-point number
* **%f
        * print a floating-point number 
* **%g
        * print a general-format floating-point number
* **%i
        * print an integer in base 10 
* **%o
        * print a number in octal (base 8)
* **%s
        * print a string of characters 
* **%u
        * print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number
* **%x
        * print a number in hexidecimal (base 16) 
* **%%
        *print a percent sign (\% also works)
