# Requirements
General
#
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
#

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gn
All your files should end with a new line
#
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
#
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
#
You are not allowed to use global variables
#
No more than 5 functions per file
#
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
#
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
#
Don’t forget to push your header file
#
All your header files should be include guarded
#
Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project
#

# _printf
This repository contains a group project of printf equally contributed by Kaleab Girma and Joseph Mulugeta.
This project contains a project task for defining a printf custom function with format specifiers based on the concepts we have covered with Alx software engineering till now.
## What is Printf?
Printf function is a function that is defined in the stdio.h header file and used to print texts and parameters specified by limited number of format specifiers.
### Format Specifiers
format specifiers are special set of placeholders used to represent a parameter to be passed in the function of printf.
The following are some of the format specifiers we use in printf function.
* %c
        * print a single character %d print a decimal (base 10) number 


* %e
        * print an exponential floating-point number
* f
        * print a floating-point number 

* %g
        * print a general-format floating-point number
* %i
        * print an integer in base 10 
* %o
        * print a number in octal (base 8)
* %s
        * print a string of characters 
* %u
        * print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number
* %x
        * print a number in hexidecimal (base 16) 
* %%
        *print a percent sign (\% also works)
